    <h1>Happy Birthday, Honey!</h1>
    <div id="message" class="typewriter">
        I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m even doing this, but here it isâ€”a special happy birthday from a stranger youâ€™ve never met in person, yet someone who once felt a deep connection with you.  
        <br><br>
        I still donâ€™t know why we stopped talking, but those memories... they were something special. I donâ€™t usually message anyone first, but that dayâ€”20th October at 7:36 p.m.â€”was different. It meant something to me.  
        <br><br>
        When I got your reply, it honestly felt like a mini heart attackâ€”in the best way possible.  
        <br><br>
        Iâ€™ve always felt unlucky in life. I donâ€™t normally put in effort for anyone, nor do I try to. But for some reason, I did for you. I donâ€™t even care much about others, yet with you, it was different.  
        <br><br>
        Maybe this is pointless, maybe notâ€”but if somehow you recognize me through this message, that alone would mean a lot.  
        <br><br>
        Your favorite word, the one I still remember: "BAs".  
        <br><br>
        Happy Birthday to you! ðŸŽ‚  
        <br><br>
        Enjoy your day to the fullestâ€”with joy and happiness.  
        <br><br>
        And lastly...  
        <br><br>
        I wish we could talk again like we used to.  
        <br><br>
        I donâ€™t know what misunderstanding created the distance between us, but if thereâ€™s a chance to clear it up, Iâ€™d be truly grateful.  
        <br><br>
        It might not mean much to you, but to meâ€”it means a lot.  
        <br><br>
        Just have a beautiful day. You deserve it.
